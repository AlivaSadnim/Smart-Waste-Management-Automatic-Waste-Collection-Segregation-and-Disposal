The designed trash collecting bot has three major parts- I) Line following Robot that carries a bin and robotic arm, II) A robotic arm to collect the trash, III) Bin containing sensors to segregate trash.

ROBOTIC  CAR  DESIGN (Hardware Part)

1. Designing the line follower robot.
2. Laser cutting ply-wood as per designed.
3. Buying and assembling necessary components.
4. Making appropriate connections to give power supply to every circuit component.
5.Connecting Arduino pins with circuit components for further software implementation.

ROBOTIC  CAR  DESIGN (Software Part)

1. Writing code for the bot to follow line and make appropriate turns as per necessary. When the end of line is reached , the bot spins and searches for the line to return.
2. While finding trash on the line at an appropriate distance , the bot automatically stops and starts moving again when the trash has been picked up.
3. Implementing weight balancing and speed control.
4. Testing and debugging to make sure the bot works properly under adverse condition of the track.
